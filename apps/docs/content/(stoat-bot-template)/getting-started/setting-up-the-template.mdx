title: Setting Up the Template
---

<Callout>
  This guide assumes you have Visual Studio Code installed. You can use any code
  editor you like, but the instructions may be different for other editors.
</Callout>

Now that you have the prerequisites installed, we can start setting up the template. Open the code editor you've installed and open the terminal.

Navigate to the folder where you want to create your bot and clone the repository using Git or download it as a ZIP file and extract it to a folder.

## Opening the Terminal

You can open the terminal in Visual Studio Code by going to `View > Terminal` or by using the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>`</kbd>.

Check to make sure you have Node.js and optionally Git installed by running the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
node --version
git --version
```

## Cloning the Repository

If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timeworn/stoatjs-bot-template
cd stoatjs-bot-template
```

If you don't have Git installed, you can download the repository as a ZIP file from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/timeworn/stoatjs-bot-template) and extract it to a folder.

## Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder in the terminal and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash tab="npm"
npm install
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn install
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm install
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun install
```

This will install all the dependencies in the `package.json` file to the `node_modules` folder.

## Renaming the files

The template comes with some example files that you need to fill out before you can start the bot.

- Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the `TOKEN` variable with your bot token. You can get your bot token by following the instructions in the [next section](./creating-a-bot).
