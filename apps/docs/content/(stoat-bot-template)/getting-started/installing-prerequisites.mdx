title: Installing Prerequisites
---

Before we can start using the template, we need to install the following prerequisites:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- A code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

## Installing Git (Optional)

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes made to your code. You don't need Git for this template, but it is recommended. You can install Git by going to their [website](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installing Node.js

<Callout>
  It is recommended to use a Node.js version manager such as
  [nvm](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
</Callout>

In order to use stoat.js, you need to have the latest LTS version of Node.js installed on your computer. You can do so by going to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Alternatively, you can use a Node.js version manager such as [nvm for windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

## Installing a Code Editor

Using a code editor is not required, but it is highly recommended. It'll make a difference like night and day. You can use any code editor you like. I personally use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

Here are some other code editors you can use:

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)

## Using a Linter and Formatter

It is recommended to use a linter and formatter to help you write clean and consistent code. The template comes with ESLint, but you can use any linter and formatter you like. If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extensions to get linting and formatting support in the editor.
