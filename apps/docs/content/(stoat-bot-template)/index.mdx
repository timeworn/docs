[StoatJS Bot Template](https://github.com/timeworn/stoatjs-bot-template) is a template for making Stoat bots using [StoatJS](https://github.com/stoatchat/javascript-client-sdk). This template sets up most of the core code such as command and event handling and creation.

This template was meant for me to use for my own bots, but I decided to make it public in case anyone else wanted to use it. It is not meant to be a full-featured bot template, but rather a starting point for making your own bot.

This documentation will cover the following:

- How to set up the template
- How to create commands and events

## Before You Start

Before you start, you should have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js. While it is possible to use this template without any prior knowledge by brute force or vibe coding, it will be much easier if you have some experience with JavaScript.

Here are some resources to get you started:
